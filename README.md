# 🏡 Advance House Price Prediction  
This repository contains a **Supervised Machine Learning** project using **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on various features.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset.  
- Built and trained a **Linear Regression model** using **Scikit-Learn**.  
- Evaluated the model using **R² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**.  

## 📂 Files Included  
- `Advance House Price Prediction.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with full code  
- `USA_Housing.xls` → Dataset *(if public, or provide a link to the source)*  
- `Project Report.pdf` → Summary of the analysis and findings  
- `Testing and Training` → Folder containing key visualizations  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repo:  https://github.com/2-0-0-5-emil/Linear-Regression-Housing.git
2. Open `Advance House Price Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
3. Run the cells to train and evaluate the model!
